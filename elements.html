									<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
									<p>During the course of my work experience, I developed not only my technical skills, but I also learned a lot about my approach to long-term projects and teamwork. Please see my reflections below.

										<h2>On Attitude:</h2>
										<p>While working on a particularly difficult task, I found that my attitude, specifically my belief in my ability to solve a problem, had a big impact on the success of the task. Once I realized that, I was able to bring a more positive attitude to problem-solving, knowing that optimism would help me solve the challenge.</p>

										<h2>On Teamwork:</h2>
										<p>During the course of my work experience, I had to work as part of a team to design a solution. At first, I just listened to other people’s ideas, but soon when the group could not agree on a path forward, I was able to synthesize a few of the ideas others’ suggested to propose a plan that we all agreed on. I learned that listening is a critical skill in teamwork, as well as making connections between seemingly different ideas.</p>
